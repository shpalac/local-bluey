# LEGACY (#158): builds the old Swift-package "Googly Eyes.app" from
# Package.swift + Mac/ + Shared/. The shipped app is the Flutter app -
# use \`make build-macos\` / \`flutter build macos\` instead. This script
# stays for reference until the Swift package is retired.
# Builds "Googly Eyes.app" into build/ from the Swift package. Works with just the Command Line Tools.
